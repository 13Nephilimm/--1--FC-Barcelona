          Barça's new stadium replaced their old ground of Les Corts which with
          a capacity of just 48,000 was too small to accomodate the interest
          generated by a team led by Hungarian star Ladislao Kubala. The stadium
          was designed by architects Francesc Mitjans Miró and Josep Soteras
          Mauri, with the collaboration of Lorenzo García Barbón, and it was
          constructed between 1955 and 1957, using mainly concrete and iron. The
          whole project cost a staggering 288 million pesetas, which meant the
          club would spend the following years heavily in debt. Although it was
          originally going to go under the official name of Estadi del FC
          Barcelona, it soon came to be popularly known as the 'Camp Nou' (the
          new ground), as opposed to the clubs old home at Les Corts. It was not
          until the 2000/2001 season that, following a postal vote made by the
          Club membership, that the decision was made to make Camp Nou the
          official name of the stadium. Of the 29,102 votes the club received, a
          total of 19,861 (68.25%) preferred Camp Nou to Estadi del FC
          Barcelona. The stadiums maximum height is 48 metres, and it covers a
          surface area of 55,000 square metres (250 metres long and 220 metres
          wide). In accordance with UEFA stipulations, the playing area has been
          downsized to 105 metres x 68 metres.

          With a capacity of 99,354, it is now the biggest stadium in Europe.
          However, the total capacity has varied over the years owing to
          different modifications. When it was first opened in 1957, it held
          93,053 spectators, which would be increased to 120,000 in 1982 on
          occasion of the FIFA World Cup. However, the introduction of new
          regulations outlawing standing areas reduced the stadiums capacity in
          the late 1990s to just under 99,000. In the 1998-99 season, UEFA
          recognised the services and facilities at Camp Nou by awarding it five
          star status. In 2010, in line with the new UEFA regulations, this
          category was replaced by the new 'Category 4' title which corresponds
          to the stadiums which fulfill the most demanding requirements with
          regards to facilities, services and capacity such as FC Barcelona's
          ground. Of the different facilities on offer inside the stadium, of
          particular note are a chapel next to the changing rooms, the
          presidential box, the VIPs lounge, the press rooms, several television
          studios, the Sports Medicine Centre, the Operative Control Unit (UCO),
          the veteran players area, the FC Barcelona club museum, and the
          offices of all of the many different Club departments.
